/**
 * PrebufferManager — a rolling pre-trigger buffer for HKSV recordings.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM
 * -----------
 * A recording only starts once HomeKit asks for one, which is downstream of
 * Google's Pub/Sub delivery. Measured on a live deployment (2026-07-29):
 *
 *     Google event timestamp -> Pub/Sub delivery :  2.0-2.3s (best), median 7.5s
 *     delivery -> ffmpeg connected + keyframe    : ~1.0s
 *     ------------------------------------------------------
 *     event timestamp -> first recorded frame    : ~3.3s (best case)
 *
 * and Google's own detection lag sits BEFORE its timestamp, unmeasured. Someone
 * walking to a door is routinely gone by the first frame, so HomeKit's on-device
 * People/Animals/Vehicles analysis finds no subject and SILENTLY DISCARDS the
 * clip -- with every layer reporting success and `reason=NORMAL` on close.
 *
 * Separately, HomeKit *asks* for footage before the trigger (`prebufferLength`);
 * that requirement is additive to the lateness above. To honestly serve a 4s
 * advertised prebuffer we need 4 + ~3.3 = ~7.3s of history, hence the 12s default.
 *
 * THE APPROACH
 * ------------
 * Continuously remux each camera out of go2rtc with `-c copy` -- no encoding, so
 * the cost is a few percent of one core -- into fragmented MP4, and keep the last
 * N seconds of fragments in memory. On a trigger the recorder is fed
 * [buffered history] + [live], so it begins in the past.
 *
 * Fragmented MP4 rather than mpegts because every `moof` starts at a keyframe and
 * box headers are self-describing, so safe cut points need no codec parsing. This
 * is also exactly the format HksvStreamer already consumes. Measured here:
 * ~1.67s per fragment, init segment 1285 bytes, ~150KB/s => ~1.8MB per camera.
 *
 * ANCHORING
 * ---------
 * Callers request history relative to the *event timestamp*, not to "now".
 * Connection time varies with Pub/Sub latency, so anchoring to it would make the
 * recovered window vary by seconds run to run. The plugin knows the Google
 * timestamp, so it can ask for exactly what it needs.

//
// To match what Google Home actually shows, history must reach ~6-8s BEFORE the
// event timestamp, while the request itself arrives ~3.6s AFTER it -- so the ring
// must span ~11.6s. 12s would sit exactly on that edge; 15s leaves margin for the
// jitter in delivery latency without costing anything meaningful: ~150KB/s per
// camera => ~2.3MB.
//
// This does NOT rescue the long tail of Pub/Sub latency (median 7.5s across a day,
// p75 47.8s): a 15s ring cannot span a 48s-late delivery, and for those events the
