# Compare what is actually DEPLOYED against what this repo ships.
#
# Drift is normally found by accident — you go looking at one file for an
# unrelated reason and notice it is older than the repo. Everything else stays
# invisible. This makes it a command instead.
#
# STRICTLY READ-ONLY WITH RESPECT TO THE DEPLOYMENT. It never writes, patches or
# restarts anything on the target box, on purpose: a "checker" that can also fix is how a
# stale whole-file patch script silently reverted three weeks of hardening here on
# 2026-08-01. (It does copy deployed files OUT, into a local temp dir, and under --deep it
# npm-fetches the stock package and patches that local copy. Nothing it writes is ever on
# the deployment side.)
#
# Usage:
#   ./check-drift.sh                                  # everything on this machine
#   ./check-drift.sh --host adamandaj@192.168.1.119   # everything on a remote Pi
#   ./check-drift.sh --deep --host pi        # also prove the patches reproduce dist/
#   ./check-drift.sh --host pi --homebridge /home/adamandaj/volumes/homebridge \
#                    --scripts /home/adamandaj/scripts
#
# With --host the install locations are resolved ON THE REMOTE (~/volumes/homebridge,
# ~/homebridge, /var/lib/homebridge are probed in that order), so --homebridge and
# --scripts are only needed for a non-standard layout.
#
# Exit: 0 = in sync, 1 = drift found, 2 = could not check.
# A run that compared nothing exits 2, never 0: "in sync" over zero comparisons is
# the one answer this script must never give.
