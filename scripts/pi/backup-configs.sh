# The go2rtc image is a LOCALLY BUILT artifact -- it exists on no registry, so if the SD card
# dies it is gone unless it is here. It was captured by hand, which meant it silently fell
# behind: v4 was the newest copy on 2026-08-06 while v13 had been live since 2026-08-05, and
# on 2026-08-07 the backup still held v13 while v14 was running. Automated so the rule
# "re-capture whenever go2rtc is redeployed" stops depending on anyone remembering it.
#
# Keyed on the image TAG, not the stamp: re-running the backup daily must not write a fresh
# 83MB copy of an image that has not changed. A new tag is a new build, and only that copies.
